					<p>This collection of <a href="/collections/srilanka/browse">original photographs and drawings</a> is drawn from ethnographic research on architecture and traditional domestic life in Sri Lanka conducted in various periods between 1965 and 2012  by Robert and Bonnie MacDougall.   These original images, as well as other visual records pertain to lifeways and hereditary practices in the Central Highlands  and more particularly to a single remote Sinhala community (Rangama*/Mimure) in the hinterlands of the Kandy District. Although the collection is focused primarily on images, it also includes additional publications (under <a href="/collections/srilanka/resources">Resources</a> as addenda) pertaining  to the  community. In this way it joins a vigorous twentieth century ethnographic record on the Sri Lankan little community which is otherwise regrettably without a significant visual dimension.</p>
					<p>The idea of the unchanging village setting has long figured prominently in the public and nationalistic imagination in Sri Lanka as the locale of traditional practices and values. In his seminal work Medieval Sinhalese Art (1908) the activist and art historian Ananda Coomaraswamy framed his concern for traditional settings and practices  as a historic preservation issue. He decried the decline of traditional craftsmanship, lamenting  “I have tried to make  a picture of it  before it was too late.” The village community as the font of authentic tradition and culture is otherwise expressed in Sri Lankan literature and film and more recently in museum and commercial recreations of village life, some of which such as the agricultural exhibit at the National Museum are documented in photographs in this collection.</p>
