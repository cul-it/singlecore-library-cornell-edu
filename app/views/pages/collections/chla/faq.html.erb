				<h4 id="printing">I can print one page at a time from books on your site, but can I print out the entire book?</h4>
				<p>For a variety of copyright and technical reasons only page-by-page printing is available at this time.</p>
				<%= render partial: 'shared/top' %>

				<h4 id="missing-title">There was a title on your site earlier that is no longer there. Why?</h4>
				<p>From time to time copyright issues arise for specific titles. When this happens, the titles are removed from the site until the issues are resolved.</p>
				<%= render partial: 'shared/top' %>

				<h4 id="add-title">I know of a book or journal that should be in this collection but isn't. Why isn't this title included?</h4>
				<p>Scholars have identified what they consider to be the most important historical titles in the areas related to agriculture to be included in this site. Not every title in the subject area has been chosen to be included in the collection.</p>
				<p>CHLA is a dynamic and growing collection, and we have digitized only a portion of the titles identified. As we identify further funding sources, more titles will be added to the collection.</p>
				<%= render partial: 'shared/top' %>

				<h4 id="value">Can you tell me the value of a rare book I own?</h4>
				<p>As librarians, we can't legally appraise or authenticate books, even if we were qualified. You may want to consult a specialist.Try searching for a reputable bookseller at the <a href="http://abaa.org/">Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America</a>. There is a page for searching for booksellers by specialty and locale.</p>

				<h4 id="permission">I'm teaching a class and would like permission to copy various pages from CHLA with the intent of using this information in my lectures. What are the copyright considerations?</h4>
				<p>Some materials in this collection are protected by U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17, U.S.C.) and/or by the copyright or neighboring-rights laws of other nations. Additionally, the reproduction of some materials may be restricted by terms of copyright ownership or licensing agreements. Transmission or reproduction of protected items beyond that allowed by fair use requires the written permission of the copyright owners.</p>
				<p>Fair use should apply in this case, since your use is for non-profit educational or research purposes. That said, copyright law dictates that the total amount of material in any one volume must be limited. If you intend to print pages in order to incorporate information into your lectures or to point out interesting material to your students, that should be no problem. If you intend to print a copy of an article or book for every student in your class it would likely be a copyright violation, as it would be duplication of an entire body of work. However, each student as an individual could access the material and print a copy. If all of this sounds confusing, you're hearing the voice of U.S. Copyright Law.</p>
				<p>We invite all our users to become familiar with our <a href="/collections/chla/copyright">Copyright Statement</a> that addresses these issues in more detail.</p>

				<h4 id="acquisitions">Are you soliciting suggestions for new acquisitions?</h4>
				<p>Although the collections in CHLA were methodically selected and reviewed by teams of scholars, we are always open to suggestions for additions. Because of the breadth of subject and scope of years, some titles may emerge that were previously missed, and we would like to know about these. Feel free to contact us with your suggestions.</p>
